# Dry Demo

A demonstration project that showcases different .NET applications and libraries using the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. This repository includes various UIs and libraries to demonstrate reusability, testing, and standardization.

## Project Structure

This repository consists of the following projects:

1. **ConsoleUI**  
   A console application that provides a command-line interface to interact with the functionalities in `DryDemoLibrary`. Useful for quick testing or demonstrating core functionality in a simple format.

2. **DryDemoLibrary**  
   A core library that contains the main logic and reusable components for the demo. This library follows the DRY principle, allowing other applications in this repository to reuse its code.

3. **DryDemoStandardLibrary**  
   A .NET Standard library designed for cross-platform compatibility, enabling shared functionality across .NET applications.

4. **DryDemoLibraryTest**  
   A unit test project designed to validate the functionality of `DryDemoLibrary`.

5. **WinFormUI**  
   A Windows Forms application that provides a graphical user interface for interacting with `DryDemoLibrary`.

6. **WpfUI**  
   A Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application, offering an alternative graphical interface with richer design possibilities.
